# Welcome to Spark

My repository of resources, experiences, projects and ideas relating to Big Data in general and Apache Spark in particular.

The repository is organised into the following areas:

* [Getting Started](GETTING-STARTED.md) - a page of links and suggestions to help you get into the world of Apache Spark in particular, and Big Data in general.
* [Annotated Examples](annotated-examples) - this is a place where I take specific samples and snippets relating to Spark and Big Data that I have found around the web, and I walk through them to explain how they work. I found this useful for me, and perhaps you will too.
* [Twitter Stream Analyser](twitter_analyser) - a project to read a Twitter stream and perform Big Data analysis on the content.
* [Doc Analyser](doc_scanner) - a project to read text documents and perform textual analysis using Spark.

Have fun (I did)!
